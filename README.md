# particleDetection

## Description
This research project was proposed by ISAE-Supaero in partnership with Nucl√©tudes.
The goal was to use CMOS Image sensors (CIS) to identify ionizing particles (alpha, X-rays, cosmic-rays).

## [subDeviations.m](particleDetection/SubDeviations.m)
This function calculates the standard deviations of the submatrices of a given matrix. Since the fixed pattern noise has a small standard deviation, this criterion can be used to distinguish between particle events and the former.

## [jpgraw.m](particleDetection/jpgraw.m)
Retrives RAW data from the .JPG file.

## [main.m](particleDetection/main.m)
Opens a .JPG image with a specified integration time (see images provided) and retrives the RAW data. The image processing algorithm is comprised of a Wiener filter followed by a convolution with an event [kernel](particleDetection/kernel.mat) whose matrix is also provided. After these steps the frame obtained can be easily used for event detection using just a threshold or the subDeviations values. 

### Plots ([main.m](particleDetection/main.m )): 
* Initial frame; 
* Frame resulting from the wiener filter; 
* The convoluted frame; 
* Histogram of the average energy per event in eV; 
* Representations of all the events identified.

**NOTE**: All the constants used in the calculations were determined and calibrated for a SONY IMX219 image sensor.
